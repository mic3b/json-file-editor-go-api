# json-file-editor-go-api
API to edit JSON file, clone repo and feel free to use in your product. 

API is really Simple, If u want to use it with your Front-end APP u should remember about:
* Every Editing proccess should start with splitting JSON into Elements(use /translations/split route)
* Look how /translations/edit works, remember about request body!
* Every editing process should end with finishing(removing file from temp folder) (use /translations/finish)


Repo will be maintained and developed on an ongoing basis
